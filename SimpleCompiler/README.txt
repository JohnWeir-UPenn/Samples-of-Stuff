The jc.c method creates a simple postscript compiler that can translate into assembly simple mathmatical commands ( 5 3 +), a variety of bitwise operations (5 2 and), comparisions (3 4 le where le stands for less than or equal to), stack commands allowing you to change the ordering of numbers dynamically, and allows the user to create functions made of a series of these commands and named anything.

jc.c should be run from the command line with any of the above form of arguments and should throw the correct errors when given invalid input.
